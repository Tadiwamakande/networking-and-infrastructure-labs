Networking and Infrastructure Labs

# Networking & Infrastructure Labs  
A collection of hands-on networking and infrastructure projects demonstrating core skills in routing, switching, subnetting, VLANs, access control, wireless configuration, and enterprise network design.  
These labs were modelled using **Cisco Packet Tracer**, home-lab equipment, and standard network engineering best practices.

This repository showcases practical experience across multiple domains, including OSPF, ACLs, VLANs, SSH security hardening, IPv4/IPv6 addressing, trunking, router-on-a-stick, subnetting (VLSM), WLAN deployment, and identity & access management processes.

## Purpose of This Repository

This repo serves as a **portfolio of networking skills**, providing:

- Realistic enterprise-style network configurations  
- Hands-on router and switch configuration files  
- Detailed documentation for each project  
- Clear demonstrations of troubleshooting and verification  
- Home-lab and Packet Tracer-based scenarios that mirror real-world infrastructure tasks  

It is intended for hiring managers, engineers, and anyone interested in evaluating foundational networking competencies.

## Repository Structure

Each folder contains:

- A **Packet Tracer (.pkt)** file (where applicable)  
- A **README.md** explaining objectives, tasks, skills demonstrated, verification steps, and key learnings  
- Optional: topology diagrams and exported config files

## Projects Overview


### Multi-AP Wireless Network Deployment
Configured a multi-AP home wireless network using LAN backhaul for seamless roaming. Includes SSID alignment, security configuration, and channel optimisation.

---

### Enterprise Network Simulation  
Designed IPv4 and IPv6 addressing schemes using VLSM, configured secure router and SVI settings, implemented SSH, password policies, banners, inactivity timers, and tested connectivity to internal and external servers.

---

### Dynamic ACL Traffic Filtering (Odd/Even Logic)  
Built an extended ACL that permits ICMP only from even-numbered hosts using wildcard masking logic. Includes verification steps, reasoning, and router configuration.

---

### Advanced OSPFv2 Single-Area Configuration  
Configured a multi-router OSPF network including router IDs, DR/BDR priority, cost tuning, default route redistribution, and timer modification across point-to-point and broadcast networks.

---

### Inter-VLAN Routing & Trunking (Router-on-a-Stick)  
Implemented VLAN creation, access port assignment, trunk configuration, native VLAN handling, subinterfaces, and Layer 3 routing between VLANs.
